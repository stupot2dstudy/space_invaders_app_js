## Introduction

Space Invaders is a classic arcade game where the player controls a spaceship that moves horizontally and shoots at incoming alien invaders. The objective is to eliminate all the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.

This implementation utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a browser-based version of the game.

## Features

- **Player Control:** Move the player spaceship horizontally using arrow keys or on-screen controls.
- **Shooting Mechanism:** Shoot bullets to destroy incoming alien invaders.
- **Alien Invaders:** Multiple rows of aliens move horizontally and descend as they approach the player.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of the player's score based on the number of aliens destroyed.
- **Game Over:** End the game when the aliens reach the bottom or collide with the player's spaceship.

## Setup

To run the game locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

The game will start, and you can control the player's spaceship using the arrow keys. Shoot bullets using the space bar or designated shoot button.

## Gameplay

- **Controls:**
  - Use the `←` and `→` arrow keys to move the player's spaceship.
  - Press `Space` to shoot bullets.
- **Objective:** Destroy all the alien invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen or collide with the player's spaceship.
- **Scoring:** Each destroyed alien awards the player with points. Try to achieve the highest score possible!
